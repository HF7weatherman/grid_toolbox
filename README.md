This repository primarily contains functions to handle (ICON) data on the HEALPix grid in Python.
These functions include remapping to rectilinear latitude-longitude grids, the calculation of spherical derivatives, and much more.
However, the repository is not limited to data on the HEALPix grid, but also contains functions to calculate spherical derivatives on a rectilinear latitude-longitude grid.

Functions to calculate spherical derivatives on the HEALPix grid were adapted from those initially developed by [Divya Sri Praturi](https://github.com/dspraturi).
