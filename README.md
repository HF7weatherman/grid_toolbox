This repository primarily contains functions to handle (ICON) data on the HEALPix grid in Python.
These functions include the calculation of spherical derivatives, remapping to rectilinear latitude-longitude grids, and much more.
However, the repository is not limited to data on the HEALPix grid, but also contains functions to calculate spherical derivatives on a rectilinear latitude-longitude grid.
